This is a very short and simple videogame made by Oscar Kelk.
It simulates taking care of a cat or a dog (although it is extremely simplified). You can use commands to feed your pet, buy items for them and more.
This isn't so much a proper game as it is a little project for me to spend some time on.
Have fun.

Note: The .py file should be run inside this directory. If you wish to move it then it is recommended that you run it in a seperate directory from other files.
